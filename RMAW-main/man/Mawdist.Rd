\title{Compute the MAW distance between two GMMs}
\usage{
Mawdist(d, supp1, supp2, w1, w2, method = "Schur")
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{An integer which is the dimension of the original data}

\item{supp1}{A matrix that stores the mean and covariance for the first GMM.
More specifically, the dimension is (d+d\emph{d)x(J_1+J_2+...+J_N),
where d is the dimension of the original data.
For each column of supp, the first d rows store the mean vector,
#' and the last d}d rows store the vectorized covariance matrix for each component.}

\item{supp2}{A matrix that stores the mean and covariance for the first GMM.
The format is the same as the details in supp1.}

\item{w1}{A vector of weights for the first GMM that sum to 1.}

\item{w2}{A vector of weights for the second GMM that sum to 1.}

\item{method}{Methods to compute the square root of a matrix. Default is "Schur" for
Schur decomposition. Users can select "PRACMA" indicates use pracma packages directly for computation
or "Eigen" that uses eigen-decomposition.}
}
\value{
Returns a list that contains MAW distance between two GMMs as well as
the optimal transport between them.
