\title{Compute the signed Minimized Aggregated Wasserstein (MAW) Distance}
\usage{
newMawdist(d, supp1, supp2, w1, w2, method = "Schur")
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Integer. The dimension of the Gaussian components.}

\item{supp1}{Matrix. A \code{d x n1} matrix where each column is a Gaussian component (mean vector) of the first GMM.}

\item{supp2}{Matrix. A \code{d x n2} matrix where each column is a Gaussian component (mean vector) of the second GMM (typically the barycenter).}

\item{w1}{Numeric vector. A vector of length \code{n1} containing the mixture weights for \code{supp1}. Must sum to 1.}

\item{w2}{Numeric vector. A vector of length \code{n2} containing the mixture weights for \code{supp2}. Must sum to 1.}

\item{method}{Character. The method to compute pairwise Gaussian Wasserstein distances. Default is \code{"Schur"}.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\describe{
\item{dist}{Numeric. The minimized aggregated Wasserstein distance with cosine similarity adjustment.}
\item{gammaij}{Matrix. The optimal transport plan (coupling matrix) between the two GMMs.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the signed MAW distance between two Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs),
where the components' Gaussian parameters are provided as supports.
The distance is computed using Gaussian Wasserstein pairwise distances,
optimal transport, and cosine similarity-based adjustment.
}
\details{
The function first computes pairwise Gaussian Wasserstein distances between components of \code{supp1} and \code{supp2},
solves an optimal transport problem based on the weights \code{w1} and \code{w2}, and applies cosine similarity
between shifted vectors to modulate the final distance.

# Example usage:
d <- 2
supp1 <- matrix(rnorm(2 * 3), nrow = 2)
supp2 <- matrix(rnorm(2 * 4), nrow = 2)
w1 <- rep(1/3, 3)
w2 <- rep(1/4, 4)
result <- newMawdist(d, supp1, supp2, w1, w2)
